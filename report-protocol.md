# Protocol for Writing a Report

This protocol adapts Patrick Winston's framework for effective communication from his MIT lecture "How to Speak" to the craft of writing reports. It posits that success in report writing is determined by the ability to articulate insights clearly, the quality of outcomes derived from internal sources, and structured analysis, in that order. The core principle is that report writing is a learnable skill, not just an innate talent. The formula for success is: Success = Knowledge + Practice + (small t) talent.

The primary goal of this protocol is to guide writers in packaging and presenting outcomes from internal knowledge bases—such as documents, observations, data logs, or proprietary insights—in a coherent document that informs, persuades, or drives action. It addresses the core problem of how to structure a report to ensure its findings are understood, valued, and acted upon without relying on external references.

## 1. How to Start: Establishing the Report's Foundation

The primary goal at the start is to capture the reader's attention and provide a clear rationale for the report, setting a tone of relevance and utility based on internal context.

- **Core Problem:** How to orient readers immediately to the report's purpose amid busy schedules.
- **Mechanism:** Begin with an "empowerment promise"—outline what actionable insights or decisions the reader will gain from the outcomes.
- **Nuts and Bolts:**
  - **Don't:** Open with generic background or unrelated details that bury the key outcomes. Avoid diving into raw data without framing.
  - **Do:** State the report's objective upfront, summarize the internal sources (e.g., "Based on Q3 observations and internal logs..."), and promise specific benefits (e.g., "This report reveals efficiency gains, enabling better resource allocation"). This motivates continued reading by linking to internal needs.

## 2. Core Heuristics: Maintaining Coherence and Reader Focus

These techniques ensure the report flows logically while reinforcing key outcomes, acknowledging that readers may skim or get distracted by operational demands.

- **Cycling:** Reiterate core findings from internal sources multiple times. With readers potentially multitasking, reference outcomes in the executive summary, body, and conclusions with varying emphasis to ensure key points stick.
- **Building a Fence:** Define the report's boundaries by specifying what outcomes are covered (and not) based on the internal knowledge base. This clarifies scope, e.g., "This analysis draws from team observations but excludes vendor data."
- **Verbal Punctuation (Adapted to Writing):** Employ clear markers like numbered lists, bolded subheadings, or phrases ("First... Next... Finally..."). These create "seams" in the document, helping readers who pause to resume easily.
- **Asking Questions:** Integrate rhetorical questions derived from internal observations to guide the narrative (e.g., "What patterns emerge from these logs?"). This mimics analytical thinking and re-engages readers.

## 3. The Tools of the Trade (and Their Mechanisms)

Analyze and select elements for compiling and presenting internal data, considering their effects on clarity and reader comprehension.

- **Time and Place (Writing Environment):**
  - **Time:** Draft during focused periods, like early mornings when insights from internal reviews are fresh, avoiding fatigue-induced errors.
  - **Place:** Work in a quiet, organized space; "case" your internal documents beforehand to ensure all sources are accessible and integrated smoothly.
- **Outlines and Drafts (Analogous to Blackboards):**
  - **Function:** Best for developing and conveying outcomes methodically.
  - **Mechanism:** Build the report incrementally, pacing the reveal of insights to match reader absorption. This provides a "target" for organizing thoughts and fosters deeper engagement with the material.
  - **Hypothesis:** Iteratively drafting from internal notes activates "empathetic mirroring," helping writers anticipate reader reactions for more intuitive explanations.
- **Props (Analogous to Visuals or Examples):**
  - **Function:** To illustrate outcomes memorably using internal elements.
  - **Mechanism:** Embed charts, timelines, or anonymized case examples from observations to demonstrate findings physically (e.g., a graph of efficiency trends). This conveys conviction in the data.
- **Sections and Formatting (Analogous to Slides):**
  - **Function:** Best for exposing outcomes succinctly, not exhaustive elaboration.
  - **"Crimes" to Avoid (The Nuts and Bolts):**
    - **Too Many Words:** Steer clear of verbose sections; readers process one idea at a time—if overwhelmed, they skip ahead.
    - **Repeating the Obvious:** Don't restate data visuals verbatim; use them to complement text.
    - **Clutter:** Remove unnecessary headers, footers, or decorative elements. Opt for large, readable fonts and simple layouts to promote brevity.
    - **Distractions:** Avoid hyperlinks or appendices that disrupt flow; keep everything self-contained.

## 4. Special Cases: Applying the Protocol

Adapt the system for specific report objectives or types.

- **To Inspire (Motivational Reports):** The core mechanism is passion. Highlight why the outcomes are "cool" or transformative, using internal success stories to energize readers toward action.
- **To Teach "How to Think" (Analytical Reports):** Frame outcomes as "storytelling." Present internal observations as narratives, outline questions for evaluation, and detail analytical mechanisms to impart a replicable mindset.
- **A Decision-Making Report (To Persuade):**
  - **Core Problem:** Convince stakeholders quickly with internal evidence.
  - **Mechanism:** Establish early:
    - **Vision:** A key challenge from observations + proposed solutions.
    - **You've Done Something:** List steps in data review and highlight achievements (e.g., "Phase 1: Log analysis—identified bottlenecks; Phase 2: Recommendations—outlined fixes").
- **To Get Famous (Make Outcomes Memorable):**
  - **Mechanism:** Use the "Winston Star"—a 5-point heuristic for packaging insights.
  - **Components:** Symbol (a visual icon, like a flowchart), Slogan (a catchy phrase, like "observation-driven optimization"), Surprise (unexpected patterns from data), Salient Idea (a single pivotal finding), and Story (a narrative of the discovery process).

## 5. How to Stop: Concluding the Report

The conclusion is prime "real estate" to reinforce outcomes and prompt next steps.

- **Core Problem:** How to end decisively, leaving readers with clear takeaways from internal sources.
- **Mechanism:** Summarize key outcomes and implications to solidify the document's value.
- **Nuts and Bolts:**
  - **Final Section:** Focus on "Key Outcomes" or "Recommendations." Avoid weak closers like "In conclusion" or open-ended queries; keep this prominent for reference.
  - **Final Words:** Do not end with platitudes like "Thank you for reading." Instead, use a strong convention: include a forward-looking insight, a call to action (e.g., "Implement these for immediate gains"), or a "salute" acknowledging the team's contributions and the report's role in advancing internal goals.
